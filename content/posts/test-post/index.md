# Basics of Markdown
Markdown is the most popular markup language that can be used to format documents. It can be used to create _websites_, _ebooks_, _emails_, and _chats_ in discussion forums*.

## Topics
1. Paragraphs 

    MD expects a full line space to show texts in a different line else it joins text in the same line.
2.  Text decorations

    MD can write **bold** texts, ~~italic~~ *italic*  texts
3. Headings
    No of #'s represent the type of heading. GitHub will automatically add IDs to headings, so the text will be automatically linked. 
    ## This is h2
    ### This is h3
4. Links

   [My Github](https://github.com/bhupendra1011 "all repos") account.[Bhupendra][1] GitHub repo.

5. Images

    Images can be used just like links. ![Alt txt](image URL)

    !["cat Img"](./images/200.jpeg "cat")

6. Ordered and Unordered Lists

    Coding Best Practices:

    * Keep code DRY
    * Writing Unit Test cases
    * Checking cross-browser support

    Steps to merge branch:

    1. Create a branch from the feature
    1. commit your changes
    1. push your changes
    1. raise a pull request

7. Code Blocks

    This is super helpful when posting any code snippet
    ```cs
    [DllImport("E://Run//GynLock.dll", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
    public static extern void controlGL(int doWhat);
    static void Main() {

    }
    ```
