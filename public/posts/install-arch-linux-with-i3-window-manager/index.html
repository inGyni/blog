In this guide, I will explain each step of installing Arch and tell you the best practices while doing so.\nRequirements You’ll need a few things to install Arch on your computer:\nInternet (Ethernet is Recommended) 4GB USB Drive Arch Linux Live Install ISO Downloading the Arch Linux ISO There are a few ways to download Arch, the most common ways are Torrenting and HTTP Direct Downloads.

You can find the download page here.\nI will be using Arch version 2023.01.01\nWriting the ISO to a USB To install Arch, you first need to write the ISO file to your USB Drive, to do so, you can use programs like Rufus or Balena Etcher. Both can do the same thing but Balena Etcher is easier to use if you’ve never done this before. I will show you how to flash using Rufus:\nWARNING\nThis will erase everything on your USB Drive, please backup your files before continuing.\nRufus may seem more advanced, but it is really simple, follow these simple steps:\nSelect your USB Drive in the first option Select your Arch Linux ISO Select your Partition Scheme (More info below) How to find your partition scheme Press Win+R and type msinfo32 and press Enter.\nYou will see a new window popup, look for something called BIOS Mode and you should see either Legacy or UEFI on the right.\nThis means which mode your BIOS uses to manage drives and partitions.
